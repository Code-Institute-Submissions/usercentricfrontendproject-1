	<h1>So you want to learn how to DJ?</h1>
	<p>
		Isn't it everybody's dream at some point to either be a rockstar or a DJ
		(or both!)? The idea of playing the music that you love to hordes of
		adoring fans and everything else that goes along with it. Unfortunately, I
		can't promise that you will become rich and famous, or even that you can
		make a career out of it. But what I can offer is years of experience, as
		someone who has spent countless hours on both sides of the DJ decks, and a
		clear, defined path to go from absolute beginner (or whatever starting
		point you are at personally) to developing the skills needed to be
		confident in your own abilities to play the music you love to the best of
		your ability. Whether you are already a weekend warrior who hangs on every
		mix and blend that your favourite DJ makes, or if you don't know your
		faders from your filters, everyone is catered to with my comprehensive DJ
		course. You will learn to know your equipment inside out, to the point
		that you could use it with your eyes closed, and you will learn how to
		craft consistent mixes, getting the most out of your tunes, no matter
		which genre(s) you enjoy playing. The course also includes constant
		feedback - I will be available to listen to and critique your skills as
		you develop them throughout the course, to offer guidance and tips along
		the way as your progress from being a curious casual to a demon behind the
		decks! Check out the video below for a sneak peek into what the course has
		to offer you:

	<h2>Tips for aspiring DJs:</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<i class="fas fa-record-vinyl">
          Know your music! This is by far the most important thing to know for
          any DJ - you could have a record bag full of bangers but it's no good
          if you play the songs at the wrong point! Listen to your music again
          and again and until you are confident enough to hear a clip and know
          at what point in the song you are at.
        </i>
		</li>
		<li>
			<i class="fas fa-headphones">
          Deconstruct the songs in your mind down to their base elements -
          different drum sounds i.e kick drum and percussion, guitar, bass,
          synth, vocals and so on. Your aim is to mix the elements from two or
          more different songs together. This will help you find which songs go
          together and which ones clash
        </i>
		</li>
		<li>
			<i class="fas fa-volume-up">
          When finding which songs work together, group them in 3s. practice
          mixing in and out of these songs until you are confident you can mix
          them whichever way. Keep doing it in threes until you have enough for
          a whole set, and are prepared for whatever shifts in energy that may
          occur.
        </i>
		</li>
		<li>
			<i class="fas fa-music">
          Take your listener on a musical journey - through highs and lows, and
          varying levels of energy. You will soon get tired if you just play
          high energy bangers one after the other with no lull in between! You
          can only appreciate the light if you have seen the darkness, and vice
          versa.
        </i>
		</li>
		<li>
			<i class="fas fa-play-circle">
          To expand on the previous point, if you are playing to an audience, be
          aware of the time and the energy of the crowd - if you are playing the
          opening set, don't play the biggest crowd pleasers or high tempo music
          - not only will you tire out the crowd early on but you could also
          seriously annoy the other DJs or even worse. The opening DJs are
          supposed to ease into the right mood, not steal the show!
        </i>
		</li>
		<li>
			<i class="fas fa-file-audio">
          When playing a show, bring twice as much music as you anticipate to
          play. You never know how the crowd might react to certain songs,
          however you planned the show in your head. If they love a particular
          song, you can play something similar. if they dislike it, you should
          have something a little different to fall back on and rescue the
          dancefloor!
        </i>
		</li>
		<li>
			<i class="fas fa-headphones-alt">
          If you use a digital DJ controller with a computer/ laptop, use any
          opportunity you can to practice using other equipment
          (turntables/CDJs) - it never hurts to expand your skillset and you
          never know what equipment you might be asked to play with if you are
          performing elsewhere!
        </i>
		</li>
		<li>
			<i class="fas fa-compact-disc">
          Have fun! Everybody has their own personal tastes when it comes to
          music, and everyone has their own concepts of what DJing should or
          shouldn't be like. But you are on your own path. Don't let other
          people's opinions or snobbiness derail your own personal journey - you
          can never please everyone, so just be yourself, and most importantly -
          love music and enjoy yourself!.
