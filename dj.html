      <h1>So you want to learn how to DJ?</h1>
      <p>
        Isn't it everybody's dream at some point to either be a rockstar or a DJ
        (or both!)? The idea of playing the music that you love to hordes of
        adoring fans and everything else that goes along with it. Unfortunately,
        I can't promise that you will become rich and famous, or even that you
        can make a career out of it. But what I can offer is years of
        experience, as someone who has spent countless hours on both sides of
        the DJ decks, and a clear, defined path to go from absolute beginner (or
        whatever starting point you are at personally) to developing the skills
        needed to be confident in your own abilities to play the music you love
        to the best of your ability. <br />
        <br />
        Whether you are already a weekend warrior who hangs on every mix and
        blend that your favourite DJ makes, or if you don't know your faders
        from your filters, everyone is catered to with my comprehensive DJ
        course. You will learn to know your equipment inside out, to the point
        that you could use it with your eyes closed, and you will learn how to
        craft consistent mixes, getting the most out of your tunes, no matter
        which genre(s) you enjoy playing. <br />
        <br />
        The course also includes constant feedback - I will be available to
        listen to and critique your skills as you develop them throughout the
        course, to offer guidance and tips along the way as your progress from
        being a curious casual to a demon behind the decks! Check out the video
        below for a sneak peek into what the course has to offer you:

        <h2>Here are some tips for aspiring DJs:</h2>
        <ul class="fa-ul">
          <li>
            <i class="fa fa-headphones">
              Know your music! This is by far the most important thing to know
              for any DJ - you could have a record bag full of bangers but it's
              no good if you play the songs at the wrong point! Listen to your
              music again and again and until you are confident enough to hear a
              clip and know at what point in the song you are at.
            </i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i class="fa fa-headphones">
              Deconstruct the songs in your mind down to their base elements -
              different drum sounds i.e kick drum and percussion, guitar, bass,
              synth, vocals and so on. Your aim is to mix the elements from two
              or more different songs together. This will help you find which
              songs go together and which ones clash
            </i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i class="fa fa-headphones">
              When finding which songs work together, group them in 3s. practice
              mixing in and out of these songs until you are confident you can
              mix them whichever way. Keep doing it in threes until you have
              enough for a whole set, and are prepared for whatever shifts in
              energy that may occur.
            </i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i class="fa fa-headphones">
              Take your listener on a musical journey - through highs and lows,
              and varying levels of energy. You will soon get tired if you just
              play high energy bangers one after the other with no lull in
              between! You can only appreciate the light if you have seen the
              darkness, and vice versa.
            </i>
          </li>
          <li>
           <i class="fa fa-headphones">
              To expand on the previous point, if you are playing to an
              audience, be aware of the time and the energy of the crowd - if
              you are playing the opening set, don't play the biggest crowd
              pleasers or high tempo music - not only will you tire out the
              crowd early on but you could also seriously annoy the other DJs or
              even worse. The opening DJs are supposed to ease into the right
              mood, not steal the show!
            </i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i class="fa fa-headphones">
              When playing a show, bring twice as much music as you anticipate
              to play. You never know how the crowd might react to certain
              songs, however you planned the show in your head. If they love a
              particular song, you can play something similar. if they dislike
              it, you should have something a little different to fall back on
              and rescue the dancefloor!
            </i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i class="fa fa-headphones">
              If you use a digital DJ controller with a computer/ laptop, use
              any opportunity you can to practice using other equipment
              (turntables/CDJs) - it never hurts to expand your skillset and you
              never know what equipment you might be asked to play with if you
              are performing elsewhere!
            </i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i class="fa fa-headphones">
              Have fun! Everybody has their own personal tastes when it comes to
              music, and everyone has their own concepts of what DJing should or
              shouldn't be like. But you are on your own path. Don't let other
              people's opinions or snobbiness derail your own personal journey -
              you can never please everyone, so just be yourself, and most
              importantly - love music and enjoy yourself!.
