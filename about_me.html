        <h1>
          My name is Gareth, and I am a bank of sonic (tutorials and tips!)
        </h1>
        <p>
          Hello, and thank you for visiting my site! I have been a lifelong
          music lover (as have most people) - from dancing around the room to my
          mother's favourite records when I could barely stand, to the present
          day. But it was around the age 16 that I decided that I wanted to not
          only write my music, but also sculpt my own sounds too - inspired by
          the likes of Brian Eno, Jean-Michel Jarre snd John Cage. As one of my
          A-level options at age 16, I chose to study a BTEC in Music
          Technology. At this very early stage, I had no idea about any concept
          of electronic music production (I didn't even know what a synthesizer
          was - to me it was just 'keyboards!'). <br />
          <br />
          My first ever lesson, I was taught about drum machines. And the rest,
          as they say, is history. From those humble beginnings, I continued to
          develop my knowledge, using different DAWs (Digital Audio
          Workstations) until I found the right fit for me - Propellerhead's
          Reason. During break and lunchtimes, our teacher would let us go into
          the music technology room and experiment with whatever gear was lying
          round - anything from samplers to theremins. This grew into using the
          software at home and making music and learning about synthesis and
          other principles whenever I had the chance. <br />
          <br />
          At this time I was also developing a passion for dance music, namely
          Dubstep and Drum and Bass music - the former, a more sparse, darker
          sound, the latter typically very energetic and filled with rolling
          percussion. As well as exploring and utilising the production
          techniques involved, I was listening to DJs mixing my favourite songs
          together seamlessly - almost creating new songs in that zone between
          both tracks as they took the listener (me!) on a journey. Several
          years later, I bought a preowned Vestax vci-100 digital dj controller,
          one of the first and most basic of it's kind- with no prior experience
          of how to mix or any of the principles of beatmatching, phrase
          matching, track selection and so on, my friend and I would play our
          favourite music together almost daily (my poor neighbours!), as we
          gradually were able to play well enough that we could honestly hype up
          each other's mixes and abilities without having to do some serious
          mental gymnastics! <br />
          <br />
          From then until now, I have promoted my own club nights, played at
          club nights and house parties, produced many of my own songs and spent
          lord knows how many hours trying to transport the sound from my own
          head into the software and eventually out of my speakers. I love all
          kinds of music and can usually be found drumming some kind of rhythm
          in anticipation of my next mix or time alone with my beloved Reason.
          With over 10 years of experience at this point (the time has flown), I
          want to be able to impart what I know to anyone who is thinking of
          taking up either of these amazing hobbies, or even both. I have put
          together comprehensive courses for both disciplines to help anyone
          from an absolute beginner (we all have to start somewhere!) to those
          who have had some experience but are looking to supplement what they
          know and expand their own skillset.<br />
          <br />
          I hope you enjoy my site; I am sure there will be something of value
          to you if you have landed here! I would love for you to get in touch,
          either via the Contact page or via the social media links in the
          footer of this site. Sign up to my free newsletter and you can get
          regular tips and tricks and free mixes, songs or sounds from myself
          that I wish to share with you! I wish you all the best on your musical
          journey and I will do whatever I can to impart whatever I know and
          whatever it is that will help you in your own endeavours.
