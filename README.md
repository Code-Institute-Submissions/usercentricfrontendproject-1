Design

Colour Scheme

    The main colours used blue for headings, and neutral colours such as black, white and grey for an understated visual effect

Typography

    The Lobster (Google) font is the main font used throughout the whole website for h1, h2 and h3 elements, while Open Sans is used for any other text elements, and also as a back up if the primary font does not load on the site. Lobster is a handwritten-style font which gives the site a more relaxed and informal style, and is less sterile and corporate than many typical font types.

        Imagery
            Imagery is important. The images contained within the site are all relevant to the software and creative content that potential users could access and gives an immersive feel.

    Hover.css:
        Hover.css was used on the navigation bar to give the effect of piano keys being pressed.
    Google Fonts:
        Google fonts were used to import the 'Lobster' and 'Open Sans' fonts into the style.css file which, between them, cover all text elements on all pages throughout the project.
    Font Awesome:
        Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.
    jQuery:
        jQuery came with Bootstrap to make the navbar responsive but was also used for the smooth scroll function in JavaScript.
    Git
        Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
    GitHub:
        GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.
   

Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

    W3C Markup Validator - [Results 'about me'](documentation/about-me-validation.png)
    W3C Markup Validator - [Results 'contact'](documentation/contact-validation.png)
    W3C Markup Validator - [Results 'design'](documentation/design-validation.png)
    W3C Markup Validator - [Results 'dj'](documentation/dj-validation.png)
    W3C Markup Validator - [Results 'home'](documentation/home-validation.png)
    W3C Markup Validator - [Results 'production'](documentation/production-validation.png)
    

        *note: errors in the markup validator on came from external code for the soundcloud and mixcloud players - these players were fully functional on the actual site
