      Do you have a song or a sound in your head that is just waiting to be
      fully realised?
    </h1>
    <p>
      They say that 'everyone has one good book in them'. Well, I believe the
      same is true about music or even individual sounds. The human imagination
      is so wildly creative that for many people, if their creativity is not
      channelled in the right way, they can feel uncomfortable or act out of
      character. What if I told you that you are potentially weeks away from
      learning a new language, so to speak, that could give you a voice and a
      form of expression unlike anything you have experienced before? This is
      not some 'rock star' course, I cannot guarantee you any adoring fans or
      even mild success. But I can teach you everything I have learned in the
      decade-plus that I have been creating music and sounds. Using what I have
      learned through trial and error over many years, I have created a complete
      roadmap to become a competent music producer. The creativity is down to
      the indivual, nobody can teach you how to write a good song. But I can arm
      you with all the tools you need to create the music that you want, from
      making the indivual sounds, to arranging them together, to fine-tuning
      every little element until you have maximised the potential of your idea,
      from a tiny seed in your imagination to a fully fledged song that you can
      share with the world (if thats what you desire), or just to give yourself
      some musical therapy, basking in the sounds that you created yourself.
      Below is an outline of the modules and content of the course:
